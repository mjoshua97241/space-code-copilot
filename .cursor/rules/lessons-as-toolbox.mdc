Rule name: lessons-as-toolbox

Content:

Past bootcamp lesson notes and code live under internal/lessons in this repo.

Behavior required:

- Treat everything under internal/lessons/ as REFERENCE ONLY.
- Use them as a toolbox for patterns, not as a template to clone.
- When I ask you to implement something in this project, you MUST:
  - Start from the current project structure:
    - backend/app/{api,services,models,core}
    - frontend/src/{App.tsx,components}
  - If you reuse code from internal/lessons, only copy the minimal snippet needed (e.g., a FastAPI route pattern, a RAG pipeline pattern, an agent skeleton).
  - Immediately rename and adapt the snippet to this domain:
    - Use Room, Door, Rule, Issue, Code-Aware Space Planning Copilot naming.
    - Remove unused tools, routes, or agents from the snippet.
- You MUST NOT:
  - Copy entire projects or modules from internal/lessons into this app.
  - Introduce new stack choices from lessons (e.g., different frameworks) unless I explicitly ask.
- If there is a conflict between patterns in internal/lessons and the patterns documented in .cursor/memory_bank/systemPatterns.md, follow systemPatterns.md for this project.
